# Macmillian7500
[Macmillian Dictionary](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/) is my favoir dictionary. The book marked the most common words with 3 star leavls:  
Three-star words are the most common 2,500 words in the language.  
Two-star words are the next most common 2,500.
one-star words are the next most common 2,500.

I uploaded three files to reference the three levels.
[star1](/star1)  //one-star level
[star2](/star2)  //two-star level
[star3](/star2)  //three-star level
